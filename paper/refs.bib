  abstract = {{There is an abundance of information about drugs available on the
	Web. Data sources range from medicinal chemistry results, over the
	impact of drugs on gene expression, to the outcomes of drugs in clinical
	trials. These data are typically not connected together, which reduces
	the ease with which insights can be gained. Linking Open Drug Data
	(LODD) is a task force within the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C)
	Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLS IG). LODD has
	surveyed publicly available data about drugs, created Linked Data
	representations of the data sets, and identified interesting scientific
	and business questions that can be answered once the data sets are
	connected. The task force provides recommendations for the best practices
	of exposing data in a Linked Data representation. In this paper,
	we present past and ongoing work of LODD and discuss the growing
	importance of Linked Data as a foundation for pharmaceutical R\&D
	data sharing.}},
