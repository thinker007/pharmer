This is a test \cite{Khalili2012}.

\section{E-Prescriptions}
E-health has evolved and emerged recently in many forms. 
E-prescription is one of these forms and is a computer-generated prescription utilized by healthcare providers.
They perform an important role in improving the quality of patient care.
While even nowadays paper prescription are commonly used, electronic prescription has offered several advantages.
E-prescriber electronically send an accurate, error-free and understandable prescription directly to a pharmacy from the point-of-care.
Improved confidentiality and security of health information, better clarity and communication among health care providers as well as rapid information exchange are part of arguments for spreading this systems.
Reduction in medication error and decline in adverse drug events are more highlighted consequences of e-prescribing.
It is also evident by using the E-prescription the following up of patient individuals is more convenient.
The health care providers can access to the patient's profile and the transfer of these data can appropriately be done.
Besides, the data of medicines consume and the connection between diagnosed disease and the treatment regimen as well as patient fate after the medication duration is not only work material of  physicians and pharmacists, but also are the very informative ones for the researchers.
Many researchers  the are seeking the statistical data and try to combine them with what they got from the medicine producers. Many others are really interested in comparisions for example between the special drug consumer age range or much more other senarios which could be obtained using E-prescription system.
During the recent years has been spreading rapidly. To illustrate, the Australian government started launching of e-prescription from 1 March 2007.
Using this system the e-providers who can effectively market themselves on the web will have a distinct advantage.
A system called epsos perform the use of E-prescritions all around europe, is currently passing the extensive practical testing phase.It contains patient summery and E-Prescription Service which allows access to the cross-border eHealth services when seeking healthcare in participating epSOS pilot countries, as tourists, business travellers, commuters or exchange students.
The E-Prescribing Incentive Program is performed in US as a reporting program that uses a combination of incentive payments and payment adjustments to encourage electronic prescribing by eligible professionals.
