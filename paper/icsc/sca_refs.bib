  abstract = {In the context of the semantic Web, notions of collaboration, interoperability,
	and reuse are intrinsically interrelated: interoperability implies
	reuse, which in turn is a form of collaboration. If we adopt this
	viewpoint, the semantic Web becomes essentially a medium for knowledge
	exchange, in which the knowledge produced by one agent is consumed
	by another agent, possibly to create new knowledge. A collaboration-centric
	perspective on the semantic Web introduces both challenges and interesting
	research directions. Clearly, it's no longer desirable that the process
	of authoring semantic content necessarily take place in a room full
	of experts and ontologists. Indeed, as we move from classic Web 2.0
	technologies to scenarios in which semantic content is created, our
	technologies need to change so that it becomes possible to create
	and exchange knowledge transparently, in accordance with the medium's
	openness and the knowledge producers' various goals and skill levels.
	In this article, we examine three modalities for collaborative semantic
	authoring based on selecting and reusing external, open semantic
	resources. These three ways of creating semantic content correspond
	to three levels of interaction between the user and the created resources.
	We illustrate each level by describing a tool we designed in the
	context of our research on semantic Web applications at the Knowledge
	Media Institute.},

	the cornerstones of #Web#2.0. Web 2.0 applications generally run
	in a web browser, propose dynamic content with rich user interfaces,
	offer means to easily add or edit content of the web site they belong
	to and present social network aspects. Well-known applications that
	have helped spread Web 2.0 are blogs, wikis, and image/video sharing
	sites; they have dramatically increased sharing and participation
	among web users. It is possible to build knowledge using tools that
	can help analyze users' behavior behind the scenes: what they do,
	what they know, what they want. Tools that help share this knowledge
	across a network, and that can reason on that knowledge, will lead
	to users who can better use the knowledge available, i.e., to smarter
	users. Wikipedia, a wildly successful example of web technology,
	has helped knowledge-sharing between people by letting individuals
	freely create and modify its content. But Wikipedia is designed for
	people--today's software cannot understand and reason on Wikipedia's
	content. In parallel, the #semantic##web#, a set of technologies
	that help knowledge-sharing across the web between different applications,
	is starting to gain attraction. Researchers have only recently started

  number = {2, Part 1},
  abstract = {In recent years, knowledge becomes the most important asset of individuals
	as well organizations, and determines the competitiveness of an enterprise.
	Content is a knowledge container that implies what human beings transform
	their knowledge in when they want to communicate with other people.
	Therefore, effective content management can achieve the goal and
	value of knowledge management. Content management activities are
	depending on meta-content which represents the content feature and
	are generated through the procedures of content abstraction and annotation.
	In general, the content creator utilizes words and logical combinations
	to express his intentions and concepts in semantic formats that are
	comprehensible to human beings. Accordingly, managing content from
	a semantic approach can effectively improve transparency and visibility
	of the content, and guides both the content creator and the user
	to engage in seamless, semantic-based communications and interactions.
	This study proposes a semantic-based content abstraction and annotation
	approach and a semantic pattern for bridging the semantic gaps of
	content management. Based on this approach, a semantic-driven content
	management environment that features a high interoperability of content
	can be constructed to accomplish the following goals and benefits:
	(1) effectively bridging semantic gaps in the existing content management
	systems; (2) delivering the right content to the right user at the
	right time; (3) bridging the semantic gaps for the content author
	and the customer to increase the efficiency of content management;
	and (4) realizing the acquisition, analysis, access, management,
	diffusion, interpretation, and innovation of knowledge.},

	on meaning and vocabulary shared by people and computers. It aims
	at closing the semantic gap, thus enabling closer cooperation between
	people and information systems, and thereby semantically enriching
	our life-world. Ontologies and constraints are major technologies
	to let people and information systems share common meaning. Semantic
	authoring is to compose information content together with explicit
	semantic structure based on ontologies. This not only reduces the
	cost of content composition but also improves the quality of the
	resulting content, by both freeing the author from worries about
	the order of presentation and providing her a perspicuous view of
	the logical content structure. Social interactions are much more
	generally modelled in terms of constraints than in terms of workflows
	or procedures. CBTO (compositional business-task organization) is
	a constraint-based framework to concisely describe uniformities of
	social interactions and thus provides a semantic-level scheme for
	coordinating various, possibly interactive, services with each other.},

	Standard solutions and best practices for Semantic Web technologies

	In this paper we conduct an empirical survey of Semantic Web applications.

	these challenges: (a) simplifying the application architecture by
	delegating
	
	generic functionality to external service providers, and (b) assembling

  edition = {2nd},
  abstract = {{<p>"This is not a book about how to collect qualitative data but
	rather what to do with qualitative data that have been collected.
	. . . For evaluators who work with qualitative data, this book provides
	a wealth of ideas on organizing, analyzing, and presenting such data.
	It is. . . a set of resources for practicing teachers. It is well-organized,
	clearly written, and practical. I have recommended the book to graduate
	students seeking advice on ways to treat the data from their field
	studies, and they too have found it helpful."</p> <p>--Thomas A.
	Schwandt in Evaluation and Program Planning</p> <p>"Matthew B. Miles
	and A. Michael Huberman maintain a high degree of integrity in what
	they propose and how they present their material. . . . The authors
	also offer a thorough presentation of issues in qualitative research.
	The book progresses logically and will be of great assistance to
	anyone engaged in qualitative research. . . . An excellent addition
	to any researcher's library."</p> <p>--Canadian Journal of Program
	Evaluation</p> <p>"The book offers communication researchers some
	of the best recent work on qualitative inquiry in the human disciplines.
	. . . Published by Sage, the leading publisher of qualitative research
	in the social sciences today. . . . Matthew B. Miles and A. Michael
	Huberman offer a ''must-own'' text, in the revisions of their highly
	influential sourcebook on qualitative data analysis. . . . This second
	edition updates the 1984 edition, outlining a complex and comprehensive
	model for a causal, grounded theory and variable approach to the
	management, analysis, and interpretation of qualitative data. A valuable
	appendix reviews over 200 computer-assisted models of qualitative
	data analysis. . . . This work brings the communication scholar up-to-date
	on where qualitative methods are in current sociological and educational
	discourse."</p> <p>--Norman K. Denzin in Journal of Communication</p>
	<p>"The first edition of this book was terrific, and the second edition
	sets even higher standards. Matthew B. Miles and A. Michael Huberman
	simply demystify qualitative data analysis, offering practical advice
	on how to code text and how to compare cases systematically. Most
	important, they bring the conceptual power of matrix analysis to
	qualitative research. This book is not just for qualitative social
	scientists, though. It's a must-have book for anyone who teaches
	social research methods."</p> <p>--H. Russell Bernard, University
	of Florida</p> <p>"The second edition of <b>Qualitative Data Analysis</b>
	is a stunning accomplishment, a major advance beyond their first
	edition. Thoroughly comprehensive in scope, well-written, and easily
	accessible, Qualitative Data Analysis provides the best developed
	and most rigorous set of analytic procedures now available in the
	social sciences. Qualitative researchers have, with this new edition,
	a revised and expanded version of their Bible. Its virtues are many:
	guidelines for reducing and displaying qualitative data; how to build
	a grounded, conceptual framework; advice on sampling and coding strategies;
	how to do within and cross-case designs and matrix displays; a thorough
	review of the ethical issues in qualitative analysis; and strategies
	for writing and presenting the final report. I recommend that this
	book be on the shelf of every qualitative researcher. No significant
	work can be done in this area without reference to Matthew B. Miles
	and A. Michael Huberman's new book."</p> <p>--Norman K. Denzin, University
	of Illinois,</p> <p> Urbana-Champaign</p> <p>"I think this is a terrific
	book, and a definite improvement over the first edition. The additions
	to Chapters 1 and 2 and the new Chapter 3, address issues that have
	become increasingly important since the first edition was published,
	and will make the book more useful and influential. The additions
	to Chapters 4 and 5 are also useful, as is the reorganization of
	Chapter 5 to make it more coherent. It's also more user-friendly."</p>
	<p>--Joseph Maxwell, Graduate School of Education, Harvard University</p>
	<p>"It is a goldmine of ideas, sources, tactics, recipes, warnings,
	aphorisms, examples, and questions. A wondrous collection."</p> <p>--Harry
	F. Wolcott, University of Oregon</p> <p>In 1984, the first edition
	of <b>Qualitative Data Analysis</b> addressed a critical need faced
	by researchers in all fields of the human sciences-how to draw valid
	meaning from qualitative data. It provided methods of analysis that
	were practical, credible, and reliable. This groundbreaking book
	has now been revised to take up where the first edition left off
	and account for the phenomenal expansion of qualitative inquiry since
	then. In the second edition, Matthew B. Miles and A. Michael Huberman
	bring the art of qualitative data analysis up-to-date, adding hundreds
	of new techniques, ideas, and references that draw on the experience
	of the authors and many colleagues in the design, testing, and use
	of qualitative data analysis methods. Each method of data display
	and analysis is described and illustrated in detail, with practical
	suggestions for adaptation and use. The growth of computer use in
	qualitative analysis is reflected throughout this volume, which also
	includes an extensive appendix on criteria useful for choosing among
	the currently available analysis packages.</p> <p>Using examples
	from a host of social science and professional disciplines and stressing
	a hands-on, practical approach, <b>Qualitative Data Analysis</b>,
	Second Edition, remains the most complete treatment of this topic
	available to scholars and applied researchers. </p>}},

	a more practical approach: Reflect uses augmented browsing to allow
	end-users to add systematic semantic annotations to any web-page
	in real-time, typically within seconds. In this paper we describe
	the tagging process in detail and show how further entity types can
	be added to Reflect; we also describe how publishers and content
	providers can access Reflect programmatically using SOAP, REST (HTTP
	post), and JavaScript. Usage of Reflect has grown rapidly within
	the life sciences, and while currently only genes, protein and small
	molecule names are tagged, we plan to soon expand the scope to include
	a much broader range of terms (e.g., Wikipedia entries). The popularity
	of Reflect demonstrates the use and feasibility of letting end-users
	decide how and when to add semantic annotations. Ultimately, [`]semantics

  abstract = {Despite significant progress over the last years the large-scale adoption
	of semantic technologies is still to come. One of the reasons for
	this state of affairs is assumed to be the lack of useful semantic
	content, a prerequisite for almost every IT system or application
	using semantics. Through its very nature, this content can not be
	created fully automatically, but requires, to a certain degree, human
	contribution. The interest of Internet users in semantics, and in
	particular in creating semantic content, is, however, low. This is
	understandable if we think of several characteristics exposed by
	many of the most prominent semantic technologies, and the applications
	thereof. One of these characteristics is the high barrier of entry
	imposed. Interacting with semantic technologies today requires specific
	skills and expertise on subjects which are not part of the mainstream
	IT knowledge portfolio. A second characteristic are the incentives
	that are largely missing in the design of most semantic applications.
	The benefits of using machine-understandable content are in most
	applications fully decoupled from the effort of creating and maintaining
	this content. In other words, users do not have a motivation to contribute
	to the process. Initiatives in the areas of the Social Semantic Web
	acknowledged this problem, and identified mechanisms to motivate
	users to dedicate more of their time and resources to participate
	in the semantic content creation process. Still, even if incentives
	are theoretically in place, available human labor is limited and
	must only be used for those tasks that are heavily dependent on human
	intervention, and cannot be reliably automated. In this article,
	we concentrate on this step in between. As a first contribution,
	we analyze the process of semantic content creation in order to identify
	those tasks that are inherently human-driven. When building semantic
	applications involving these specific tasks, one has to install incentive
	schemes that are likely to encourage users to perform exactly these
	tasks that crucially rely on manual input. As a second contribution
	of the article, we propose incentives or incentive-driven tools that
	can be used to increase user interest in semantic content creation
	tasks. We hope that our findings will be adopted as recommendations
	for establishing a fundamentally new form of design of semantic applications
	by the semantic technologies community.},

  abstract = {A semantically-linked web of electronic information – the Semantic
	Web – promises numerous benefits including increased precision in
	automated information sorting, searching, organizing and summarizing.
	Realizing this requires significantly more reliable meta-information
	than is readily available today. It also requires a better way to
	represent information that supports unified management of diverse
	data and diverse Manipulation methods: from basic keywords to various
	types of artificial intelligence, to the highest level of intelligent
	manipulation – the human mind. How this is best done is far from
	obvious. Relying solely on hand-crafted annotation and ontologies,
	or solely on artificial intelligence techniques, seems less likely
	for success than a combination of the two. In this paper describe
	an integrated, complete solution to these challenges that has already
	been implemented and tested with hundreds of thousands of users.
	It is based on an ontological representational level we call SemCards
	that combines ontological rigour with flexible user interface constructs.
	SemCards are machine- and human-readable digital entities that allow
	non-experts to create and use semantic content, while empowering
	machines to better assist and participate in the process. SemCards
	enable users to easily create semantically-grounded data that in
	turn acts as examples for automation processes, creating a positive
	iterative feedback loop of metadata creation and refinement between
	user and machine. They provide a holistic solution to the Semantic
	Web, supporting powerful management of the full lifecycle of data,
	including its creation, retrieval, classification, sorting and sharing.
	We have implemented the SemCard technology on the semantic Web site
	Twine.com, showing that the technology is indeed versatile and scalable.
	Here we present the key ideas behind SemCards and describe the initial
	implementation of the technology.},

	autocompletion and linguistic concept extraction. The system is being
