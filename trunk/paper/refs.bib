	and connecting structured data on the Web. These best practices have
	been adopted by an increasing number of data providers over the last
	three years, leading to the creation of a global data space containing
	billions of assertions - the Web of Data. In this article we present
	the concept and technical principles of Linked Data, and situate
	these within the broader context of related technological developments.
	We describe progress to date in publishing Linked Data on the Web,
	review applications that have been developed to exploit the Web of
	Data, and map out a research agenda for the Linked Data community
	as it moves forward.}},

	the ease with which insights can be gained. Linking Open Drug Data
	(LODD) is a task force within the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C)
	Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLS IG). LODD has
	surveyed publicly available data about drugs, created Linked Data
	representations of the data sets, and identified interesting scientific
	and business questions that can be answered once the data sets are
	connected. The task force provides recommendations for the best practices
	of exposing data in a Linked Data representation. In this paper,
	we present past and ongoing work of LODD and discuss the growing
	importance of Linked Data as a foundation for pharmaceutical R\&D
	data sharing.}},
