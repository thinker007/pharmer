\section{Introduction}
This is a test \cite{Khalili2012}.

\section{Semantic Content Authoring}
\label{sec:sca}

\section{E-Prescriptions}
E-prescriptions are computer-generated prescriptions utilized by healthcare providers.
They perform an important role in improving the quality of patient care.
E-prescriber electronically send an accurate, error-free and understandable prescription directly to a pharmacy from the point-of-care.
While even nowadays paper prescription are commonly used, electronic prescription has offered several advantages.
Improved confidentiality and security of health information, better clarity and communication among health care providers as well as rapid information exchange are part of arguments for spreading this systems.
Reduction in medication error and decline in adverse drug events are more highlighted consequences of e-prescribing.
During the recent years has been spreading rapidly.To illustrate, the Australian government started launching of e-prescription from 1 March 2007.
