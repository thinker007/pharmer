    abstract = {{We present Paged Graph Visualization (PGV), a new semi-autonomous tool for RDF data exploration and visualization. PGV consists of two main components: a) the "PGV explorer" and b) the "RDF pager" module utilizing BRAHMS, our high per-formance main-memory RDF storage system. Unlike existing graph visualization techniques which attempt to display the entire graph and then filter out irrelevant data, PGV begins with a small graph and provides the tools to incrementally explore and visualize relevant data of very large RDF ontologies. We implemented several techniques to visualize and explore  hot spots  in the graph, i.e. nodes with large numbers of immediate neighbors. In response to the user-controlled, semantics-driven direction of the exploration, the PGV explorer obtains the necessary sub-graphs from the RDF pager and enables their incremental visualization leaving the previously laid out sub-graphs intact. We outline the problem of visualizing large RDF data sets, discuss our interface and its implementation, and through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of PGV.}},

	approach to document production by using his LaTex program, appreciating
	the ability to concentrate on the content and leave the formatting
	to the program--until recently. With the success of editable web
	pages by the advent of wikis and its most popular application, Wikipedia,
	logical text production as Lesley Lamport described it, has found
	its way into the mainstream. There is a long standing discussion
	in the wiki world on whether to move back to visual text production
	in wikis again, since end users who only know WYSIWYG editors are
	suddenly confronted with wiki markup which they find disturbing at
