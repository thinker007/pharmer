**Pharmer** helps prescribers such as clinicians or health care staff to write semantic medical e-prescriptions easily.
A semantic prescription is a self-contained document which is aware of its content and is connected to the linked open data.
In contrast to database-oriented e-prescriptions, semantic prescriptions can easily be exchanged among other e-health systems without need to changing their related infrastructure.
The online demo of Pharmer is available at http://bitili.com/pharmer
